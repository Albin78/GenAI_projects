      "the distinction between thinking and intelligence. Thinking is the facility to \n",
      "reason, analyze, evaluate, and formulate ideas and concepts. Therefore, not \n",
      "every being capable of thinking is intelligent. Intelligence is perhaps akin to \n",
      "efficient and effective thinking. \n",
      "Many people approach this issue with biases, saying that computers are \n",
      "made of silicon and power supplies and therefore are not capable of think-\n",

      "On the other hand, proponents of strong AI are concerned with the \n",

      "The previous section posed three questions, and the first two questions \n",
      "have already been addressed: how do you determine intelligence, and are \n",
